### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_MANUEL_LUIS_QUEZON_DESC:0 "Manuel Quezon was born on Aug. 19, 1878, to Lucio Quezon and Maria Molina, both schoolteachers, in Baler, Tayabas (now Quezon) Province, in Luzon. Manuel enrolled at San Juan de Letran College, after which he was appointed lecturer at the University of Santo Tomás. There he studied law, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Spanish-American War.\n\nIn 1907 Quezon ran successfully as candidate for the Philippine Assembly on the Nacionalista party platform. In the Assembly he was elected floor leader, and Sergio Osmeña, his archrival, became Speaker of the House. Quezon served as resident commissioner in Washington, D. C. (1909-1916), where he became notorious as a romantic dancer, playboy diplomat, and shrewd lobbyist. He was instrumental in having a law revised so that Filipinos would form a majority in the Philippine Commission, the highest governing body in the Philippines. In February 1916 he cosponsored the Jones Act, which gave the Filipinos the power to legislate for themselves subject to veto by the American governor general. With this act, Quezon returned home a hero."
POLITICS_MANUEL_ROXAS_DESC:0 "Manuel A. Roxas was governor of the province of Capiz in 1919–21 and was then elected to the Philippine House of Representatives, subsequently serving as Speaker of the House and a member of the Council of State. In 1923 he and Manuel Quezon, the president of the Senate, resigned in protest from the Council of State when the U.S. governor-general (Leonard Wood) began vetoing bills passed by the Philippine legislature. In 1932 Roxas and Sergio Osmeña, the Nacionalista Party leader, led the Philippine Independence Mission to Washington, D.C., where they influenced the passage of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act. Roxas was later opposed by Quezon, who held that the act compromised future Philippine independence; the Nacionalista Party was split between them on this issue. In 1934, however, Roxas was a member of the convention that drew up a constitution under the revised Philippine Independence and Commonwealth Act."
POLITICS_EMILIO_AGUINALDO_DESC:0 "Emilio Aguinaldo was born on March 22, 1869, in Kawit, Cavite, Philippines. Nicknamed Miong, Aguinaldo was the seventh of eight children. His parents were of Chinese and Tagalog descent. His father, Carlos, died when Aguinaldo was just nine years old. Widowed, his mother, Trinidad, sent him to attend public school in Manila.\n\nWhile serving as the head of barter in Manila, he joined the Pilar Lodge chapter of the Freemasonry in 1895. The Freemasonry was a government- and church-banned resistance group. It was through his role as municipal captain of this fraternity that Aguinaldo met Andres Bonifacio, a key figure in the fight to overthrow Spanish rule."
POLITICS_BASILIO_J_VALDEZ_DESC:0 "Basilio J. Valdes was professor of Surgery at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), Manila and Medical Director of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. He was appointed chief-of-staff of the Philippine Constabulary in the 1930s.\n\nHonest, hardworking, and conscientious, Dr. Valdes and his achievements here and abroad have given prestige to his country and to himself. He went to France and joined the French Army as medical volunteer in 1916. He transferred to the U.S. Army a year after and continued to serve as surgeon until 1919. In February of the same year, he was appointed member of the Inter- Allied Commission to Germany; made chief of the Medical Service of the American Red Cross Commission to Germany, and later appointed Deputy Commissioner of the American Red Cross in Europe."
POLITICS_JOSE_P_LAUREL_DESC:0 "Jose P. Laurel, in full José Paciano Laurel, was born March 9, 1891, Tanauan, Luzon. Laurel was born and raised in a town south of Manila. His father served in the cabinet of Emilio Aguinaldo in the late 1890s. The younger Laurel received a law degree from the University of the Philippines in 1915 and an advanced jurisprudence degree in 1919 before earning a doctorate in civil law from Yale University in the United States in 1920. He entered politics and was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1925, serving there until he was appointed as Interim President of the new Philippine Republic."

The United States have successfully annexed the archipelago, crushing the revolutionaries along the way. While the Tydings-McDuffie Act have granted the Philippines autonomy and an independence within 10 years, it came to the earlier than expected however as the Great Depression have made the United States grant independence to the Philippines to ease of expenditures.\n\nToday the Second Philippine Republic is an independent nation, forging its own path into the world, while there have been again threats to the Filipino nation, only time will tell if it can survive the next major global conflict."

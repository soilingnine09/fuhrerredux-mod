### Events ###
alb.1.t:0 "The National Liberation Movement finds more rural support"
alb.1.d:0 "Despite our police force's best efforts to keep order many of our citizens in rural regions have sympathies towards the NLM cause. It's is feared that many villages in the Korab mountains may even be harboring NLM personal, giving them the food and equipment needed to harass our army. Very little has been invested into properly dealing with this crisis which will only exacerbate the issue as time progresses."
alb.1.a:0 "We must increase police presense in the Korab mountains"
alb.4.t:0 "Liberation Day parade"
alb.4.d:0 "Though originally neutral in the Great War, Albania was drawn into the conflict when Austria invaded in a so called 'Friendly Occupation'. This was soon followed by a joint French-Italo intervention into southern Albania. The war in Albania lasted until spring of 1919 when the Entente powers were able to force Austria-Hungary to retreat from Albania. The Liberation of Albania has been celebrated as a national holiday ever since the end of the Great War as a way to pay respect to the Albanian and Italian forces who's sacrifice and bravery made it possible. The annual military parade that marches through Tirana for this occasion has, in recent years, become a target of Albanian dissidents. Riots, looting and other acts of violence have become common around the parade and the local police suspect that this year will see a large Socialist presence in the area. Ferdinand has made it a tradition to lead this parade but the increase in violence has some ministers concerned over his safty. They reccomend that Ferdinand stays at his residence this year to guarantee his safty but this may lead to further loss of legitimacy for our government."

alb.4.b:0 "It's too risky. The Socialists are planning something"
alb.5.t:0 "Liberation Day bombing, The Prince is dead"

The explosion caused significant damage and lead to mass panic around the streets of Tirana. It took hours to find and identify the Prince's corpse and many more to capture the terrorist responisble, a member of the National Liberation Movement. The Prince's passing has been a massive shock to the people of Albania and Italy and sits as a reminder of how divided our nation still is."

alb.7.d:0 "A recent terror attack in Tirana has shown that Albanian security forces are too weak and unorginzed addequetly defend their nation. Today the Albanian ambassader in Rome petitions us to send more forces to help stabilize the country. The crisis in Albania only serves to weaken our position in the Adriatic but many ministers warn that the cost of futher intervention in Albania may out weigh any possible benefit.

For years the Balli Kombetar have fought Italian influence in Albania, attacking Italian settlements and buisnesses in our country but now they come to us on peaceful terms to make an offer. The only threat Frashëri despises more than Italy is socialsim. He has offered the services of the Balli Kombetar militia to help defend Albania from anymore Socialist encroachment.

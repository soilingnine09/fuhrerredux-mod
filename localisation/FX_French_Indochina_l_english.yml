#### Ideas ####
FIC_colonial_exploitation:0 "Colonial Exploitation"
FIC_colonial_exploitation_desc:0 "Despite bringing some industrial and societal improvement to the urban spheres of Indochina, French Indochina itself is a colonial possession mostly focused on economic exploitation. While Metropolitan France may claim otherwise, there is a clear lack of development into spheres of Indochina that do not concern the French, leaving parts of the country very technologically backward and lacking in infrastructure. Furthermore, the lack of incentive for local education has only harmed the literacy rate in the region, leaving an uneducated and impoverished rural population. Of course, in many ways this illiteracy and lack of investment is benefitial for the French administration as it means less political activity and a more exploitable workforce."
FIC_vietnamese_unrest:0 "Vietnamese Unrest"
FIC_vietnamese_unrest_desc:0 "Ever since Metropolitan France took over Annam, Cochinchina and Tonkin, French Indochina has not known peace. The Vietnamese are an unruly people, with a fervent nationalism and a dislike for foreign regimes that tell them what to do. This has made ruling Indochina a tightrope, where we must always be bracing for a revolt or rebellion when things go south. Even now, it is a known fact that the Indochinese are organizing and mounting a secret rebellious movement. At least Laos and Cambodia aren’t this chaotic."
FIC_the_indochinese_apparatus:0 "The Indochinese Apparatus"
FIC_the_indochinese_apparatus_desc:0 "Unlike other colonial powers who have used association with natives to rule their regions, the French have established a centralized administration over Indochina. Thus, a bureaucracy built upon a network of highly paid French administrators extends across the region, collaborating with a supervised mandarinate to rule over all of Indochina. So far, this administration has proven to be a very costly and large affair, in which the Indochinese have little say at all, regardless of their societal or political position. While this has meant that the Indochinese are in a considerably less powerful position to negotiate their autonomy, it also has meant that the Indochinese feel extremely alienated from this foreign administration, creating great hostility towards this ruling apparatus. This hostility has only been compounded by the fact that many of our administrators have little knowledge in the native languages and are oblivious to local culture and customs, and care more on how to make the most profit possible for Metropolitan France than to develop Indochina."
FIC_salt_opium_alcohol:0 "Salt, Opium and Alcohol"
FIC_salt_opium_alcohol_desc:0 "Although we do gain great revenue from Indochinese agriculture (especially that of rice), sericulture and mining, a massive portion of our budget comes from our monopoly and heavy taxation over salt, opium and alcohol- three very consumed and necessary goods in Indochina. These have given us great revenue, especially opium, which we have been directly responsible in spreading and popularizing in the cities here."

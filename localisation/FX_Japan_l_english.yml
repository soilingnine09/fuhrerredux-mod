#### Bookmark Description ####

JAP_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "Japan is rising. In less than a century it has pulled itself from an isolated, feudal society to Asia's most industrialised and modern state. Emperor Hirohito rules over an young empire that simultaneously holds dominion over Korean and Taiwan, yet upholds a democracy based on American ideals. Lacking natural resources, Japan must advance even further if it's to thrive in this uncertain world. Tennōheika Banzai!"

#####Events#####

jap.0.t:0 "The Rising Sun"
jap.0.d:0 "While other nations were immolated in the Great War, the early 20th century has been a blessing to Japan. Gaining dominion over many of Germany's former pacific territories, Japan has continously stepped into the spotlight on the world stage. \n\nHowever, the nation's dabbling in Democracy is still new, and many wish to corrupt it to suit their wishes. Many farmers struggle with the rapid pace of modernisation, and income inequality has exploded. The Zaibatsu, Japan's gargantuan conglomerates, have continued to stifle entrepreunership and innovation. It has been a golden age for Japan, but unless swift action is taken, stagnation may curse us. May the Emperor watch over us all."
jap.0.a:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!"

jap.1.d.0:0 "Ever since the First Sino-Japanese war, Korea has been firmly under our influence and in 1910, annexed into our Empire under direct rule. The situation has been met with variable responses, with recent events, the assimilation of Koreans have now been put onto our agenda. We now must decide on the speed of assimilation, or further rebellion will be more often and in much larger scale, perhaps, even a full scale independance war."

jap.2.d.0:0 "As the Fifth Fengtien-Zhili war starts to rage in Northern China, our interests in China forces our hand in support for one of the two clique, Zhili or Fengtien. One of which shall become victorious in the war and we must help one of them in their ultimate conquest to protect our interests. Now do we support the Zhili clique, whose military has proved itself time and time again, but lacks the industrial power of her neighbours, or the Fengtien governacy, whose area are wealthy in metal and owns the majority of the Manchurian railway?"

jap.3.d.0:0 "After the London Stock Market Crash, we now have a major trade deficiency as no one would buy our products. To combat the trade deficiency, our politicians have decided to cut the budget for many departments, including both branches of the military. The generals of both branches have been notified and promised an expanded budget whenever the economy has been restored."

jap.9.d:0 "The most unsettling five days in the British Empire since the start of the Great War has came, as the Empire's stock markets has been varying radically due to the fear of inability to get resources and goods from all corners of the Empire. Due to this, many British investors have withdrawn their Japanese assets and caused a panic in our own stock markets as well. Not to mention the bankrupcy of quite a few Japanese trading partners, thus crippling our economy. Who knows what will happen due to this?"

jap.11.d:0 "A military coup d'état by the Righteous Army has been set off on the 6th of September 1936, due to the result of military factionalism, constant rivalry against the government, and the recent London Stock Market Crash. This coup is is mostly comprised of young radical Imperial Japanese Army officers and their goal is to eliminate the ideological rivals, the social conservatives. Many in the opposition party say that any harsh military action against the small army would lead to open rebellion of the Army and may result in a civil war! We must act carefully to not hurt either side..."

jap.12.d:0 "With regiments of the Imperial Guard directed towards putting down the rebellion, The Righteous Army has been destroyed! The last of the commanders of the Righteous Army have been executed. The Righteous Army only managed to assassinate off few political members, as well as occupying the government center of Tokyo for a short while. Many citizens thanked the army, which came in and dealt with these traitors with no mercy. This rather unsettling rebllion may have proved to the two branches that we will crush any rebellions, but much more needs to be done before more of this happens."

jap.13.d:0 "Peace negotiations have been named, namely the unification of the military factionalism has been ended but for a cost of some political ministers of the ruling government. At the end, no Japanese life was lost at the end of the day and minimum damage has been made overall."

jap.14.d:0 "Just now, our naval exercise just off Manila, the capital of the Phillipines have succeed in it's true purpose - a surprise attack on both Filipino and American military bases and we triumphed! The president of the Phillipines is mad and the the American President is shocked at our daring raid. We will win this war against the Imperialistic Foreigners!"

jap.15.d:0 "Yesterday, Japanese planes have attacked Filipino military bases and the American embassy! There has been many casualties of both nationalities and both us and the Phillipines are mad. Both the American and Filipino public are mad and request for war soared! The Phillipines are already at war with the Japanese now, leaving only us, the United States of America not at war. Our response shall be swift and deadly, and wipe this dishonorable empire off the face of the world!"

jap.16.d:0 "With the establishment of the Imperial Ruling Assistant Association, they have started the discuss the zaibatsu problem. These Zaibatsus are major conglomerates and each own an important part of our economy and industry. But as their influence expands, they start to affect our government's policy, perhaps a little too much. Now we must decide on whether to start dissolving these Zaibatsus, or to prevent them from entering the political sphere entirely. Either will help us complete our goal, but we must decide now, or never."

jap.17.d:0 "A few days ago, the American Gunboat USS Panay fired at Japanese ships who were participating in the casual naval gunnery exercise. The captain of USS Panay said they thought that the ships were firing in anger and not exercising. While no casualties were caused, the incident proved that not just the American and Japanese government are distrustful of each other, even the militaries of both countries perform the same. Now we wait until the diet and parliament agree on a complaint to the American government."

jap.18.d:0 "With anti-Japanese sentiment rising in China, citizens of Shanghai attacked many Japanese businessmen, destroyed and vandalised Japanese-owned property, including the burning of the Sanyou factory. An upsurge of anti-Imperialist sentiment was caused and protests to boycott Japanese goods and remove the concessions to Japan also broke out. While the Chinese Nationalist government claim that this was staged by Japanese agents, regardless of this, what we will do is not yet decided on. Now what do we do?"

jap.19.d:0 "The Japanese diplomat has just sent us a number of demands, including the ability to position Japanese troops in our territories to stop these anti-Japanese sentiment and provide assistance to investigate the recent Shanghai incident. This demand will basically give up our national sovereignty and independence! But our [From.GetLeader] has not yet made any decision on the response. Perhaps he will give in to these demands or this will not. We can only wait..."

jap.20.d:0 "As our supporters, the Japanese have earned some concessions in the Fifth Fengtien-Zhili war. But now their government has become much more imperialistic and started to expand. In their path of expansion, we lie. Now as the Japanese have sent us their ultimatum, do we refuse and wage a war we can ill fight against with Japan's technological might or do we submit to the imperialistic empire? The fate of Fengtien lies here and we do not know will we survive such a conflict."

jap.201.d:0 "Despite the fact our nation's great might clearly exceeds their own, Fengtian has ignored our ultimatum."

jap.202.d:0 "Realizing Japan's great might and diplomatic conviction, Fengtian has accepted our ultimatum."

#Zhili ultimatum
jap.21.d:0 "Following multiple incidents in Qingdao, Dailian and the Manchurian peninsular, the Japanese has had enough and now sent us an ultimatum. To submit or to go to war with them. While we cannot afford to fight a war with their technological might, we cannot afford to submit either, as the entire population is doubtful of the future of Zhili under Japanese rule. All we know is that the fate and future of Zhili lies here, and we depend on it."

jap.211.d:0 "Despite the fact our nation's great might clearly exceeds their own, The Zhili Clique has ignored our ultimatum."

jap.212.d:0 "Realizing Japan's great might and diplomatic conviction, The Zhili Clique has accepted our ultimatum."

#France peace proposal
jap.22.d:0 "After the Japanese invasion of our only Asian possessions, we no longer have any holdings in Asia, and we therefore cannot fuel a war. The Japanese, through the Swiss diplomat has sent us asking for an armistice, or even peace. If we do, we will be giving up our Pacific possessions. We must consider this carefully."
#Russo-Japanese coalition
jap.23.d:0 "The Japanese, who have supported us many times in the Russian Civil War, have sent a proposal for an alliance against the reds, who currently own the vast Russian lands. If we do accept, we will gain a powerful ally who undoubtedly will support us in every possible moment and will facilitate us in conquering the vast Soviet menace."

jap.24.d:0 "The Japanese has allied with the British, and they now cooperate with them militarily. This means another knife will be pointing at us, but this time in the Pacific. While it is unknown on how will the two countries will fight against us, it is sure that the two nations will band together against us."

jap.25.d:0 "Improved relations with the United States has emboldened the Japanese to once again increase the size of their Navy which is making our most isolated colonies even more vulnerable. We must counter this hostile move from the Japanese by any means we have."

jap.26.d:0 ""

jap.27.d:0 "Diplomats from the great and powerful nation of Japan have sent us an offer to form an anti-French alliance with them. The annexation of Siamese controlled Laos by the French following Franco-Siamese War of 1893 is still a contentious issue between our two nations and many within our country wish to reverse this. While the Japanese clearly intend to pressure French interests in South East Asia some ministers are weary of becoming too dependent on the Japanese."

jap.28.d:0 "Realizing our shared interests in French Indochina, The Siamese have agreed to our offer of an alliance."

jap.29.d:0 "Despite our shared interests in French Indochina, The Siamese have refused our offer of an alliance."

jap.30.d:0 "It's clear that we and Japan hold a shared interest in weakening Soviet influence in the Far East. Military personal from Japan have come to us with a plan to test Soviet defenses in the strategic region of Yakutsk. Our military with supplies from Japan will raid this region in a small scale buy highly coordinated attack. While the USSR outnumbers us greatly Tokyo believes that focused and decisive operations can quickly defeat Soviet divisions before they can be reinforced by reserves from Europe, an evolution of the strategy used by Japan to defeat Russia in 1905. While the Japanese envoy is highly confident in this plan, local Russian officers are understandably weary of provoking the USSR but we should also be weary of upsetting our Japanese ally."

jap.31.d:0 "With the persuading of our military envoy, The Russian have agreed to out plan to raid the Soviet strategic position in Yakutsk."

jap.32.d:0 "Despite the efforts of our military envoy to Chita, The Russians have rejected our plan to attack the Soviet defenses in Yakutsk. While many back in Tokyo wish to drop the issue for now the Japanese military have little patience for the Russians and are preparing plans to install a more \"amenable\" government in Chita."

jap.33.d:0 "Reports from our Siberian garrisons have relayed that White forces have crossed our border into our Far Eastern territory of Yakutsk. The scale of this raid isn't fully known as of yet but in any case we must quickly reinforce this position and push the whites back!"

jap.34.d:0 "The \"Yakutsk Incident\" as some have begun to call it has come to a quick end. The sudden break out of violence between these two states has shocked the international community, some of whom suspect Japan in sparking the incident. All that really matters though is our decisive victory."

jap.35.d:0 "The \"Yakutsk Incident\" as some have begun to call it has come to a quick end. The sudden break out of violence between these two states has shocked the international community, some of whom suspect Japan in sparking the incident. Our surprise defeat has shocked many of our ministers and officers who are now demanding significant reforms to better prepare our army against future battles."

jap.36.d:0 "Realizing our shared ambitions against the Soviet Union, Russia has agreed to form an alliance with us."

jap.37.d:0 "Despite our historic and continued support for their little regime, Russia has refused to form an alliance with us."

jap.38.d:0 "Our attempts to find a peaceful solution to the growing political power of the Japanese Army has failed. When they threatened Japan's democracy we offered them an inch which they saw as an opportunity to take a mile. Slowly but surely Japan's civil government fell to the interests of the military. Under growing internal pressure even the Emperor himself has given into the demands of the military. What ever kind of democracy may have existed in Japan is now just a foot note in history."


jap.48.d:0 "Despite our efforts to improve relations with Britain and her people, the British Navy has refused to hand over the designs of the HMS Trafalgar. This modern ship is quite powerful and if we are to retain our place as thee dominate power in the Pacific we must create a ship that can match it's strength."

jappol.11.d:0 "To help secure the very survival of Japan's democratic government we must reform how the military operates. Currently many of our top generals operate autonomously far from the supervision of Tokyo and as such they have very little interest in parliamentary politics. While this state of affairs has allowed for our military and nation to achieve many stunning victories against our enemies it has also turned Japan into a nation that effectively has two conflicting governments. If we are to secure the stability of our nation we must reign in Japan's most ambitious commanders and install loyalists in their place."

jappol.16.d:0 "The Police have recently just took in a soldier of the Imperial Japanese Navy who is suspected to be participating in a conspiracy against the democratic government. He has not leaked any information, but what this means is that the Navy is not discouraged despite the September 6 incident, where the Righteous Army's uprising was stopped. Now that we know of such conspiracy, we must start thinking of a solution to this, in order to safeguard democracy."

jappol.17.d:0 "As the Diet notified the Emperor about the conspiracy, the Emperor has told the Diet that he intends to speak to both branches of the Military to, quote, 'Speak about the recent events'. The Diet is split on this measure, fearing that the speech may lead to criticism of the Emperor by the general public. Now if the Prime Minister agree to the speech, it may lead to either the Military giving up their plans for coups or the Emperor will be criticised. What do we do?"

jappol.18.d:0 "Isoroku Yamamoto, one of the Admirals notified by the Imperial Diet, handed over the results of his investigation on the potential coup. He pulled his strings within the Imperial Japanese Navy and discovered plenty of officers and marines who were planning to coup later this year. He compiled a list of the officers and marines and gave it to the Imperial Diet. Now what will we do with this list of officers?"

jappol.19.d:0 "Yesterday, a group of naval officers and marines took hold of the Parliament and took hostage of the legislators. They demanded that the current Prime Minister resign and let a militarist become the new Prime Minister. The Imperial Japanese Army refused to intervene and the civilian government can only give into these demands, putting the Imperial Japanese Navy in command of the Empire. What lies in front of the path of the empire is unknown, yet conflict is sure to come soon quickly."

jappol.20.d:0 "With Yamamoto's report on the naval officers and marines, the Prime Minister has ordered the mass arrests of these traitors. This has stopped the potential coup at the cost of the personnel of the Navy. We must start recovery from this purge and reinforce the superiority of the democratic government over the two branches."

japhep.1.d:0 "As the Imperial Conference of 1937 drew to a close, the British called for a conference with us so negotiations and discussions for the continuation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and other issues with Japan will continue. Delagations from Britain has reached Osaka and met for the first time today. Both delegations and governments are hopeful of this conference and wishes that both side will get what they want from the conference."

japhep.2.d:0 "With uncertainty of the ability to provide resources and economic stability after the London Stock Market Crash, many Japanese companies have resorted to trading with other countries and companies, such as American products and German iron. The British Empire suffered a rather great hit to their trade and is not satisfied by this. The British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden has therefore decided to discuss with the Japanese delegate about such trade, namely imports and exports of the Japanese Empire."

japhep.3.d:0 "As the British start to recover from the Stock Market Crash, many countries have abandoned the Gold Standard. The British delegates have told the Japanese delegates that the British government hopes to abandon the Standard or at least devaluate the Pound. The Japanese economic minister also supports such action. If we do this, we may be able to recover from the Stock Market Crash quicker."

japhep.4.d:0 "The British delegates now said that the two Empires must band together for protection against unnamed threats that are on the rise. The British delegate is certain that if Japan announces to modify the Anglo-Japanese alliance to join in and support the British Empire in any upcoming conflict, the unspecified threat will doubt any potential attack on both empires. The problem is that, do we, or do we not, fulfil such action?"

japhep.5.d:0 "With the 1937 temporal renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance soon coming to an end, we have called for a summit with the Japanese. While that is one thing off the agenda, we are not sure how will the Japanese respond to this summit, seeing our numerous acts of aggression in the interwar years. What we are doing now is nothing more than a gamble, and we can only hope for the best."

japhep.6.d:0 "With the London Stock Market Crash, many has lost much of their confidence in our economic stability and trade, many Japanese investors included. With an agreement, we can make them inclined to trade with us again with terms for guranteeing their trade and them being not affected with our tariffs. Hopefully these terms will be able to make them trade more with us again."

japhep.7.d:0 "The Gold standard is our former economic standard, while we have our plans on the standard, we do not want any of our trade partners being unable to trade with us continuously, or we will just undo the trade agreement signed previously. We shall encourage them to abandon the Gold Standard."

japhep.8.d:0 "Despite some disagreement on some terms, our delegates have reported that it may be suitable for us to ask for Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Perhaps the Japanese will finally want to continue our alliance, both for protection, or for deterrance."

japhep.9.d:0 "With much greatness, we and Great Britain has put aside our disagreements and finished the discussion of the Hirota-Eden Pact. This pact shall show the greatness of diplomacy and ensure the success of both the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Great Britain."

japhep.10.d:0 "Our delegates in Kyoto has reported back to Downing Street that the Japanese has accepted the extension of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This means that most of our hopes for the summit is fulfilled, despite most political councillors' conservative hopes. This will be the most influential conference in history. We shall rejoice at such event!"

japhep.100.d:0 "Our government, before the new elections take place, hopes to solve the problem of the not-yet-terminated Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Right now the cabinet is undergoing heavy debates at Downing Street to renew the alliance temporarily for three years. Many throughout the government are concerned if this alliance will stay for long, especially when our actions have alienated quite a lot of our former allies."

japhep.101.d:0 "Britain has just told our minister for foreign affairs that they wish to renew the Anglo-Japanese Alliance for three more years and it is up to us to decide whether or not the alliance will continue. The Navy and Army are supportive of the renewal, but the diet is divided for such action, as many acts by the British have alienated their former allies and made many enemies."

japhep.102.d:0 "The Japanese Diet has sent a letter to the Foreign Office, saying that they have decided to renew the Alliance, following our proposal of a 3 year temporal renewal, until a complete discussion later. However, the letter has stated that numerous actions by the British Empire has conflicted with Japan and her interests. It will take a lot of actions by the British Empire to undo such acts of aggression against them."

japhep.103.d:0 "The Japanese Diet has sent a letter to the Foreign Office, saying that they have decided to terminate the Alliance, against our proposal for a 3 year temporal renewal. The letter stated that too many acts of aggression was done by the British Empire against the Japanese empire and has influenced them to terminate the alliance due to not hoping to associate themselves with constant aggressors."

japhep.104.d:0 "The British diplomat to us has just left us a letter, saying that it is in their nation's interests to terminate the Alliance, due to the overwhelming uncertainty posed by our actions, drifting away from the British interests, aligning ourselves with other nations. The Diet has not made any official comment on the letter currently."

japhep.105.d:0 "As we enter [GetYear], one of the problems arise as the temporaily renewed Anglo-Japanese alliance comes to an end. With the 3 years ending without much conflict between the both nations, many think that this means the two nation's interests are once again, closer to each other. Quite a number of people support aligning Japan with us fully through inviting them to the Imperial Protection Alliance, but this must be done with thorough discussion."

japhep.106.d:0 "The British diplomat entered the halls of the Foreign Ministry today, concerned, speaking of holding a conference between the two countries. It is sure that this conference will concern the fate of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance as the temporal renewal ends. The Diet is more optimistic towards holding the conference to discuss the fate of the Alliance. Perhaps it will go miraculously and we will be happy after all, or it may go poorly and both parties will go with a sour face."

japhep.107.d:0 "Japan has notified our diplomat over there that they will not discuss the Alliance, still citing the noticible times where the British have went against the interests of Japan. Therefore, they will also terminate the alliance. The Foreign Minister has already announced that Britain will not try to attempt to keep Japan as a part of the Alliance."

japhep.108.d:0 "Japan has notified our diplomat at Japan stating that they will terminate the Alliance immediately, citing the aggression of the British actions. The Foreign Minister has stated that the British Empire will not try to continue the alliance, stating 'A unpleasant alliance is against both nation's interests'. However, a number of our political advisors has advised against just letting go."

japhep.109.d:0 "Britain has notified our diplomat to terminate the Alliance immediately, citing numerous unpleasant times of cooperation between the two nations, and how it is 'better for no relation than a mutually despiscing one'. Numerous political commentators are very suprised by Britain's actions, but have remained neutral on the issue."

japsanfran.1.d:0 "Our intelligence sharing with the Americans was just in time. With us inviting them to a summit, they accepted and proposed to hold it in San Francisco. We shall decide a solution to the HMS Trafalgar and numerous other minor items. Now we shall participate immediately, without any doubts, as time is not on our side."

japsanfran.2.d:0 "The Japanese's invitation of us to a summit about the naval problems and the pressing issue to HMS Trafalgar led to a summit in San Francisco. Now we shall participate to solve these issues. Now we must hold this summit as soon as possible, or our ships will be defeated easily."

japsanfran.3.d:0 "After 18 years of the Washington Naval Treaty which limited both ours and the United States of America's shipbuilding, the British has launched the Super Heavy Battleship HMS Trafalgar which endangers both the American and the Japanese navy. We, the Japanese shall call for a summit to declare the end of the treaty and restart the fleet construction programs of both countries to ensure the security of our seas. If the Americans does not align with our cause, we must stop following them."

japsanfran.4.d:0 "The Japanese delegates, on the first day of the Summit, has said that 'With the HMS Trafalgar, we must stop limiting our navies immediately' and called for the immediate termination of the Washington Naval Treaty, and instead, band together for naval technology sharing to catch up for the missing interwar naval development."

japsanfran.5.d:0 "Due to our reliance on importing resources, we have mentioned that we should stop importing British goods and import more American goods. But if we embargo Britain and America embargoes us, our entire economy may stop functioning properly. To prevent this, we must sign an agreement with the United States. If this is signed, we can ensure this does not happen and the USA will always support us economically and resource-wise."

japsanfran.6.d:0 "With the reliance of Japan on our exports, if we embargo them, their economy will be heavily damaged. Because of this, they have requested a trade treaty with them. With this trade treaty, we can lower our reliance of British goods. While they don't have the amount of resources Britain has, the less ties we have we the British, the less problems we will have when we go to war with them."

japsanfran.7.d:0 "With Texas being basically ran by Standard Oil, we have little way to stop such monopoly. With the Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and Kawasaki, these companies can contest the trust in Texas. We shall notify the Japanese delegates on this."

japsanfran.8.d:0 "The Americans have notified us on Standard Oil, one of the largest Oil Companies on Earth, and their monopoly over the Texan Oil industry. In order to help counter the trust that John D. Rockafeller has, the American negotiator has asked us to promote investments by the Zaibatsus, such as Nippon Oil, into the American market. This deal would help Japan secure a stable source of US oil for our growing needs while the Americans would gain a much needed source of foreign capital.”

japsanfran.9.d:0 "With the evaluation done by the Department of Defense on Pacific bases, they have concluded that we need more allies in the Pacific to supply an army against any possible interests. Now with the San Francisco Summit, it is best for us to ask, since the Pacific Bulwark will be able to fight off any aggression."

japsanfran.10.d:0 "Due to the lack of an American fortress in East Asia besides the Phillipines, which cannot fully support a full fleet of America or Guam, which is too small to supply a sized American army. If the Americans are allowed basing rights, in return we will also gain basing rights on American bases. While this might not be as well as an military alliance, this is just as good a deal."

japsanfran.11.d:0 "The Department of Defence has recommended the president to quickly propose an coalition with the Japanese. While the edges still need to be worked out, we must ensure that Japan will be with us, or if they aren't, we shall defeat them sooner or later."

japsanfran.12.d:0 "The American President, in response to the great acceptance to their proposals, have proposed one last add-on. The American-Japanese Alliance. The forged alliance will protect both Japanese and American interest in the Pacific, combating the British imperialism. The details will be discussed only if the Japanese agreed to the Alliance first."

japsanfran.13.d:0 "The Japanese have accepted the Great Pacific Treaty! With this known, many throughout the government rejoice! With this, it is sure that the Japanese will become a definite ally of us. This means that our grand pacific alliance will be able to protect the interests of our own, no matter what."

japsanfran.14.d:0 "As negotiation talks break down, the Japanese has declared that they will not be limited by this treaty, in one way or another. Now this will mean that war will come, no body is sure, but what is sure is that the Washington Naval Treaty will no longer be valid."

japele.1.d:0 "The Election of 1936 is here. As usual, only Rikken Minseitō and Rikken Seiyūkai are competeting to be elected. This year Minseitō promised for more rights for workers while Seiyūkai hopes to modernise the railway systems. The election seems to be neck and neck and no one seems to be able to win completely. Who will win this year?"

japele.2.d:0 "As the new Parliament starts to draft a new budget for the upcoming two years, the both branches of the Military are asking for the priority. We only have enough money for one of the two branches, so who shall we provide it to? The staggering army needs extra funding for expansion to ensure the security of our overseas possessions and research? Or the aging navy of which many ships have aged and needs modernisation and improvements completed soon?"

japele.3.d:0 "The Elections of 1938 is here. With the many crisis we have gone against, we shall choose a new and strong government. Minseitō has been calling for more rights for workers, while Seiyūkai wishes to in"

japtraf.5.d:0 "Our spies have reported to our Naval Attache in Britain that a new battleship is on trial, named HMS Trafalgar. Not just any normal battleship. She is a super heavy battleship, armed with brand new, state-of-the-art 18 inch guns, unopposed armor and an unrivaled amount of Anti-Air armament. She is so powerful, that one of her can rival 3 or 4 battleships, freeing up capital ships for the British home waters and threaten our naval supremacy in the Asian seas. We shall notify our American allies and decide our action on it."

jap.44.d:0 "As the sea trials of HMS Trafalgar continue, our Admirals panic at such a balance disrupting design so out of the blue. With some of the admirals pulling themselves together, they have written a request for a discussion within the diet. While this directly bypasses the parliament, the diet seems to not care in such time of importance. Now, with the diet finally assembled to discuss our response to such the act, we can truly decide our actions. Some in the admiralty suggest requesting the British foreign ministry for the design, while some suggest stealing it. What shall we do now?"

jap.45.d:0 "Our Foreign Office has just received a letter from the Japanese Diet, requesting that us give the Japanese navy a duplicate for the design for our state-of-the-art flagship, HMS Trafalgar. The Admiralty is currently hosting a fierce debate for the confidentiality of our trials, while both houses of the government are hosting debates just as fierce for whether or not we should hand over the designs. If we do, we can be sure that Japan will be building a ship of roughly the same displacement and analyise the weaknesses of our design, but if we don't, we will be damaging our relationship heavily. Do we risk it or not?"

jap.46.d:0 "A messenger from the Admiralty has just reached the Foreign Office, swearing as he bust into the halls of the office, informing the Foreign Secretary about the arrest of a \"sneaky bugger lurking inside the Admiralty, near the archives\". The lurker is believed by both the Scotland Yard and the Admiralty as an spy for the Japanese government, our supposed ally. Now we do not have a suitable respond just yet, but we shall accuse the Japanese for shady actions for some mere designs!"

jap.47.d:0 "Our foreign ministry has just received a document from the British diplomat, saying that it is an 'early Christmas Present' and 'the Admiralty will love it'. After analyzing, it seems that the document is the design for HMS Trafalgar. The Admiralty is very glad for the design and has started assembling a Committee for the analysis for the design. We shall send the British our utmost gratitude."

jap.49.d:0 "Bakayaro! Our spy who was sent to steal the designs of Trafalgar was caught, and the British are accusing us of provoking aggression and the British populace is up in arms! The most outrageous nationalistic claims of us say that we are harboring imperialistic hopes and warmonging beliefs, while the most reasonable are still biased towards the British. The Diet has already offered an official apology for the indecent act of the thief, while denying any possible connections to him. This has gone very badly despite the high expectations of the operation planners."

jap.51.d:0 "We just recently joined the ranks of the Imperial Protection Alliance, but many think we do not belong and are of inequal footing to them. For the sake of a lasting relationship, we must start securing our place in the alliance. But many in the government are debating on how should we secure our place. Our most obvious ways is to persue more economic cooperation inside the Imperial Protection Alliance, or to persue more military cooperation by trading military technology."

jap.52.d:0 "The Japanese diplomat has just met with the Foreign Secretary and shown Japan's hopes for persuing further economic cooperation, by more mutual economic trade and investments. He claims this is due to the dissentient by other allies. They have already started drafting a proposal for economic investment, ranging from new steam locomotives and new civilian planes to brand new shipping route services. The Japanese are very keen for securing their place in the Alliance as an integral part, inseperable."

jap.53.d:0 "The Japanese diplomat has just met with the Foreign Secretary to discuss Japan's hopes for persuing further military cooperation. He claims that this is due to dissentient by other allies. The two Foreign ministers have discussed how can the two cooperate further. Some concepts include some war games in different terrain to further train the troops in different terrain and exchanging advisors for doctrine development. The Japanese are very keen for securing their place in the Alliance as an integral part, inseperable."

jap.hol.friends.of.our.friends.are.our.friends.d:0 "Japan wishes to join our faction and as a representative of the Stahlpakt in Asia we get to decide whether or not to accept Japan into the faction. Adding them to the faction would help our and German's influence over Asia and may get help in the near future, namely reclaiming our former colony of Indonesia."

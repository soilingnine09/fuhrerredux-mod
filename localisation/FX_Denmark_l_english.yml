#### Description ####
DEN_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "The Danish Realm survived the Great War relatively unscathed, but it was the interwar period in which political strife took its toll on the Kingdom. The 1920s saw the Easter Crisis and the Abdication Crisis, two events which culminated in King Christian X breaking with constitutional norms in order to assert the sovreignity of Denmark and weaken the power and influence of the left-wing elements in the nation. After these political crises, the democracy and republicanism were established and after the first election the Social Democrats led the nation into the new decade. It remains to be seen where Denmark will go and how it will act in future crises."

#### IDEAS ####

While the Republican forces in the country are too weak to take power, this can change if future crises occur."

###EVENTS###
denmark.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Denmark"
denmark.1.d:0 "At the dawn of the 20th century, Denmark was entering an era of change, becoming a modern country. The power of the monarchy was questioned, and extended suffrage ensured the transition into a true democracy.\n\nWhen the dusk settled after the Great War, an opportunity to regain land was presented to the Danish nation. But the two plebiscites held in the northern parts of Schleswig, would also be the source for a crisis in Danish politics, when king Christian X dismissed the government when the government refused to declare new elections. With the support of the Armed Forces and the political right-wing, the king did not bow to this pressure. In the end, the crisis concluded with the Danish invasion of Flensburg and new elections.\n\nWhile the crisis ended with a win for the right-wing, it quickly developed in the other direction. Republican sentiments grew in the left-wing Social Democrats and Communists, as well as the popularity of these parties. After the establishment of the Norwegian Republic in 1927, the Social Democrats presented a proposal for a similar referendum on the monarchy. This was, however, voted down. But with the 1929 election, the socialist parties would gain a majority. This set off a second major crisis in modern Danish politics. The crisis would see the end of the reign of king Christian X, along with the establishment of a Republican party in Denmark and the start of the first Social Democratic government.\n\nWhile Denmark has mostly recovered from the crises of the 1920s, there does still harbor republican sentiments in the country. The rise of the Valkists in Germany has also triggered increased riots and protests in Flensburg and a radicalization of the politics of Southern Jylland. It is to see if Denmark will be able to come through future crises, despite these issues."

denmark.68.t:0 "Danish Victory in Flensburg Plebiscite"
denmark.68.d:0 "The Flensburg Plebiscite was in the beginning a plebiscite where the Pro-German side had an early lead. But during the campaign season, the Pro-Danish side managed to strike their message to the German population in Flensburg, making many rethink their vote. At the end, it was now the Pro-Danish side that had the lead. The winning side has been efficient in painting the plebiscite more as a Dano-German vs Valkist plebiscites than a Danish vs German one."
denmark.68.a:0 "Out With the Champagne!"

denmark.69.t:0 "Denmark Won the Flensburg Plebiscite"
denmark.69.d:0 "The Flensburg Plebiscite has resulted in a Danish victory. While we are almost uncapable to believe it, the fact seems to indicate it. While we can not point to any foul play by the Danish government, this result does not mean we will give up so easy."

denmark.100.t:0 "The Republican-Social Democrat Merge"
denmark.100.d:0 "Republicanism in Denmark has recently begun to lose steam. With the king becoming increasingly more a symbolic figurehead than one with authority, most people sees the monarchy as an alright institution. The final nail in the republican dream, and the final victory of the democratic constitutional monarchy, is the unification between the Social Democrat and the Republican parties."
denmark.100.a:0 "Republicanism is Now at Rest"

denmark.101.t:0 "A Danish Republic"
denmark.101.d:0 "The key demand to be able to make a government with the Republicans was the promise of a Danish Republic. Seing our victory in the election as a sign of the Republican demand from the people, we are at once on our way to dismantle the old monarchy, replacing it with a democratic Republic. Today, King Frederick willingly abdicated the crown for him and his house, with the prime minister declaring the birth of the Republic."
denmark.101.a:0 "Thanks For Your Service, King Frederick"

denmark.102.t:0 "A Civilian Government"
denmark.102.d:0 "With the power of the Lyksborg Group unchallenged in Denmark, it is time to transition into a more civilian and democratic government. While we could continue the current government, the King sees it necessary to give more power to civilian loyalists than to military figures, so that it will be easier to hold on to power. At least, it would mean a less militaristic and autocratic government."
denmark.102.a:0 "I Love Democracy"

denmark.103.t:0 "Meeting the Two Sides"
denmark.103.d:0 "Before we can enact the temporary lockout and strike ban, we need to met the two sides in the Labour disputes; the Labour Unions and the Employer's Organizations. Without consulting them, we will likely meet opposition from both sides in this operation.\n\nLuckly, we have been able to meet with representatives of both the Labour Unions and the Employer's Organizations, presenting them with our proposed law, and giving promise that these measures are only temporary. After a couple of days of negotiations, the two sides have agreed to our temporary ban, so long that the other side follows the deal."

denmark.104.t:0 "Communist-Aligned Unions Protest"
denmark.104.d:0 "While the majority of Labour Unions in Denmark is now in agreement with the temporary ban, there are still a few unions that protest this action. Communist-aligned unions have been very critical towards our ban, calling it an authoritarian measure that profits the capitalist class. There are also a few employers that are not happy of this law either, threatening to break off from the line that the Employer's Organizations follows."

denmark.105.t:0 "Trial of the Deserters"
denmark.105.d:0 "After a restoration of relations between King Christian and his son, former King Frederick, it has been easy to regain the loyalty of the Danish navy. While we have offered leniency towards those willingly to return to their posts, we still need to take care of those that still resists. Today, many of the most treasonous members of the navy met their fate. Either in a prison cell for the years that will follow, or in the end of a noose."
denmark.105.a:0 "A Just Justice Indeed"

denmark.106.t:0 "Socialist Exodus"
denmark.106.d:0 "With our move against the dangerous and revolutionary unions in Denmark, there have been some protests from union members on the political left-wing. These developments was expected. What was not as expected was an exodus of socialist, communist and republican union members and politicians leaving Denmark to the Soviet Union or other left-leaning countries. While this might be good for our domestic fight against these subversive ideologies, it gives a rather bad image internationally."

denmark.107.t:0 "Collectivization Nearly Complete"
denmark.107.d:0 "Our efforts to collectivize Danish industry and agriculture is nearing it's completion. While we have seen some push back, opposition and unlucky deaths on it's way, the result will more than make up for that."

denmark.108.t:0 "End of Capital Oppression"
denmark.108.d:0 "Today, we see the end of the oppression Danish workers has faced from the capitalist classes. With a more democratic way in controling workplaces and industries, with the workers in control, the oppression from a useless upper class is gone."

The life of Frederick has not been all calm. His royal mission to secure his succession have seen many considerations and a failed engagement. It was first in 1935 that Frederick would wed, calming the people who wanted a future for the Danish monarchy. One of Frederick's biggest change in life is his assention to the throne through the Abdication Crisis, a move that alienated both hard line monarchists and radical republicans, but secured peace and continuation for the monarchy.\n\nFrederick himself is one at ods with the tradition of his father, former King Christian X.

Growing up in the 19th century, King Christian became king in an era of modern social change in Danish society, with the ideas of constitutionalism and democracy. This became a counter to Christian, who is described as an authoritarian and one who stressed the importance of the monarch's power. His use of power, would however lead to his fall from it during the Abdication Crisis. Since then, Christian X have lived his life as an ex-monarch in Denmark, with his son taking his role.\n\nWhile Christian was officially no longer a monarch, he still had support among conservatives and monarchists in Denmark, many of whom saw the abdication as a coup from the Social Democrats. With an alliance of military figures and conservatives, they finally managed to seize power, bringing the de-throned Christian X into power yet again."

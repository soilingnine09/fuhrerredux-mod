 ##### History #####
 SIA_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Siam humiliated with their defeat from the British and French and made territorial concessions after suing peace, this and with the recession that occurred in the 1910s have made previous Kings of Siam unpopular."

 ##### Leader Description #####
 POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC:0 "Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Supreme Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot."
 POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long."
